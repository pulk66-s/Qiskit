Plan equation: $ax + by + cz = 0$

If two vectors $v$ and $u$ are in the plane, then they solved the equation.

If $v$ and $u$ are in the plane, then $v + u$ is in the plane.

$v = \begin{pmatrix}a & b & c\end{pmatrix}, u = \begin{pmatrix}d & e & f\end{pmatrix}$
$v + u = \begin{pmatrix}a + d & b + e & c + f\end{pmatrix}$
